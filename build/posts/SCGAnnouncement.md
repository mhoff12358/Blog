@title YouTube Channel w/ Morgan @author slimelia @date 2016-06-21

Hey all,  
Just wanted to tell people about the new YouTube channel I'm a part of called [*Super Cool Gaming*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD4ugkIRUhVkCRjHH3yBCoA). It's a channel started by my good friend *Morgan "Trivia Facts"* who you can find on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/RealTriviaFacts/).

Currently Morgan and I are doing a playthrough of Mother 1 [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpUejs9An714lwV_5HpNbzSh5WXcW43u9) which you can check out. Furthermore my solo debut video, *'Team Fortress 3'* can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PNdd03Y4kk), and if you chose to watch it then I really appreciate that. &lt;3

thanks all  
xoxo
