I'm gonna try to get a blog rolling to make it easier to upload progress pics from the various projects I'm working on

My goal is to have both a personal record so I can go back and easily find stuff I've done,
but also to have a single space I can configure to avoid needing to recreate the same updates in bluesky, cohost, and like 3 discord channels.

I can be found on other websites at:

  - Cohost: [@mhoff](https://cohost.org/mhoff)
  - Bluesky: [@mhoff.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/mhoff.bsky.social)
  - Itch.io: [mhoff12358](https://mhoff12358.itch.io)
  - Twitter: [@mhoff12358](https://twitter.com/mhoff12358)

Grouping some projects by category, I've been working on:

  - AI: Somnium Files models
  - [Gunpla]({{relativelink}}pages/gunpla.html)
  - Soul Hackers 2 electronics
  - [Gamedev]({{relativelink}}pages/gamedev.html)
