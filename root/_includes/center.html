    <h1>Welcome to my Layout Maker!</h1>
    <p><strong>Please read this first!</strong></p>
    <p>This tool generates a layout that is responsive, which means it looks great on phones! Use dropdowns
        above to customize your layout's general features. Click the button to generate your HTML and CSS, and
        paste it into a file on Neocities.</p>
    <p>Then you can replace all of the text with your own. For more customization, the CSS code has comments to
        explain what each part changes. Please read through the code - even if you have no idea what it means.

    <p>If you're feeling up for a challenge, I put together <a
            href="/sadgrl/learn/understanding-tweaking-my-layout-maker/" target="_blank">a guide</a> which goes
        over the structure of how this layout is built, along with some specific tips on how to edit it in
        certain ways.</p>
