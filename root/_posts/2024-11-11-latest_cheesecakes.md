title: My Latest Cheesecakes

## I love making cheesecakes!

For whatever reason cheesecake has turned out to be my favorite dessert to make.
I find it's pretty hard to mess up, and there's lots of ways to add in a new flavor without radically changing things.
If I screw up a cake it can be dry, or not have enough frosting, or the frosting is too sweet, or whatever.
But with a cheesecake as long as I follow the recipe I never mess up in a way that makes it not taste good.

And you can scale up the amount of effort by adding sauce or whipped cream on top if you want to be fancy.
Or you can keep it simple and just make something basic.

The best cheesecake I've made is probably the one I used for the color scheme of my blog.
It turned out delicious, and I mixed the sauce in to get that really iconic marbled look.

Also I was dealing with a really rough illness at the time and eating this with friends was the first really social thing I was able to do in months, so making it was a pretty big milestone for me.

## Some others

More recently I've also made a lemon one and a pumpkin one.

The last year or two I've been doing pumpkin cheesecake instead of pumpkin pie in the fall because I've been visiting friends and me making cheesecakes has turned into a bit.
A friend made an absolutely amazing maple whipped cream to put on top of this one and it really pulled the whole thing together.

The lemon one was pretty dang good, and I'm really happy with how the candied lemon slices looked.
Unfortunately I did *something* wrong when I made them and they tasted absolutely disgusting so I had to put them on for the picture and then take them back off before serving it.
