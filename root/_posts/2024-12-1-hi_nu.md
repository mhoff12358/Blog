At some point I picked up an RG Hi Nu Gundam because it was on sale and I wanted to try building something that wasn't HG.

Then I got distracted for quuuuuuite a while and wound up doing some MG kits before I got to this one.

It was pretty interesting going from an MG original Gundam to the RG Hi Nu and seeing the number of little greebles wildly jump up.

Like, posing the original Gundam is pretty straightforward. Posing the Hi Nu I have to figure out the balance with like 3 types of fins.

Anyways, I spent quite a while watching my friends play video games while I put on the shitload of decals. I'm pretty happy with how they turned out!

I'm thinking it'll look best posed on a stand, but I don't particularly feel like buying one of the fancy stands for it.
So I'm hoping to wait a month or so until I've got my 3d printer set up and and make a wall mount or something like that.
