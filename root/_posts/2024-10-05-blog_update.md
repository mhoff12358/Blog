## Big update to the blog's look and layout

Now I'm using Jekyll to do static site generation! I'm enjoying baked in support for tagging posts, and the layout system lets me do stuff like inject one template into another.

It was missing some features I wanted, but [https://github.com/slimelia/slimeblogger](SLIMEBLOGGER) was so much nicer to get up and running.

Also, the themeing is now based off a picture of a cheesecake I made once that was pretty tasty.
