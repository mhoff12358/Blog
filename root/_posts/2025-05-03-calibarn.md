## I wanted to do some airbrush practice

I've got a few ideas for customizing model kits that will require me to do things other than just paint individual pieces a solid color.
So I decided to do make a kit where I'd include some masking and some gradients in order to just get practice in.

The idea was to make Calibarn extra witch-y, painting the gun/thruster like an actual witch broom, giving it a blue/purple color scheme, and turning the bits into fireballs.

## Putties

After my <a href="/2025/05/02/roll_finished">last kit</a> where I did a total color replacement I realized that it makes having gaps between pieces
much worse because the leaking color contrasts so much.

So the solution I found was to use putty to fill the gaps, then sand down. I tried out a few different ones to figure out which one I liked most.

<div class="image-container">
<img class="fullimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/witch_calibarn/putties.jpg" alt="Boxes for milliput super fine, tamiya putty and tamiya putty white">
</div>

I like milliput, having used it before to fill gaps on 3d model prints, but it really didn't work for this scale where there's also lots of details I don't want to cover up.
Both tamiya putties worked fine, but I could really use more practice applying them. I used some wooden coffee stirrers to apply it but afterwards found some advice to use silicone spreaders that I'll try next time.

Also for next time I picked up some vallejo water based putty that should be easier to thin and work with. We'll see how that goes on a small test.

The results weren't perfect but definitely an improvement.

<img class="halfimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/witch_calibarn/putty_butt.jpg" alt="Calibarn's back waist piece with the gaps filled and painted blue">
</div>

Note the brown backpack having more noticeable gaps (though conveniently no contrasting color shows through).
For the pieces I actually puttied I used too little putty and it contracted while drying so there's still some visible diviots but it's better.

Unrelated, but I'm pretty happy with the "leather" color I was able to mix for the backpack.

## Masking

The first airbrushing technique I wanted to practice was masking on details, so I just added some stars and wiggly stripes as they seemed to fit the theme.

<div class="image-container">
<img class="halfimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/witch_calibarn/star.jpg" alt="Calibarn's shoulder with a purple star">
<img class="halfimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/witch_calibarn/masked_line.jpg" alt="Calibarn's thigh with a purple squiggle line">
</div>

These came out pretty well, I was able to avoid much overspill and the good masking tape actually gave me a nice border. (There's a little extra purple, but that's from missing when adding a gradient elsewhere not from the actual masking step...)

## Gradients

For Calibarn itself I pained on a few purple gradients to give it some depth and texture, but nothing especially complicated.
The biggest gradient project I gave myself was painting the bits to hopefully look like fireballs its controlling floating around it.

This required a multi-colored gradient going from red to white at the tip to sell the fire effect.

<div class="image-container">
<img class="thirdimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/witch_calibarn/red_bit.jpg" alt="One of Calibarn's bits painted red">
<img class="thirdimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/witch_calibarn/orange_bit.jpg" alt="One of Calibarn's bits painted red with an orange gradient">
<img class="thirdimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/witch_calibarn/yellow_bit.jpg" alt="One of Calibarn's bits painted red with an orange and yellow gradient">
<img class="thirdimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/witch_calibarn/white_bit.jpg" alt="One of Calibarn's bits painted red with an orange, yellow, and white gradient">
</div>

I really like how these came out. Though I think I should have kept the gradient a bit tighter and left more pure red because as-is they look a bit like candy corn...

I also wanted to give the thrusters some kind of actual effect to imply they're working, so I painted the tips red.
By doing it as a really sharp angle I was able to catch just the tips, so the tips were bright red but I didn't soak the whole piece.

## Results

After doing some photo editing to remove the fishing line that held up the bits, it turned out great!
Though I still need to invest in some kind of photo booth to get better lighting and backgrounds for my shots.

Also, the pre-edit photos:
