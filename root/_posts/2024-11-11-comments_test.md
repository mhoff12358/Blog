title: I'm adding comments
---

I've wanted to add comments to this blog for a bit 'cause people giving simple feedback (even just likes) was a fun part of social media.
Especially with the scale I'm posting at where this means 1-10 likes, not anything that I can get too worked up over.

I think I'm gonna go with [HTML Comment Box](https://www.htmlcommentbox.com/) as they let me moderate aggressively on the free tier.

Also you might need to clear your cache to get the updated CSS that makes the comments section not ugly. Hit ctrl+shift+R to reload without the cache.

The moderation policy is set to require me to approve every message no matter what, so there shouldn't be any spam or abusive stuff getting in.

I'm also gonna use this post to test the integration so the comments for this one will be me talking to myself.
