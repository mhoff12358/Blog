## New airbrush setup

For the final cohost build club I started a project to color swap the Roll.exe and MegaMan.exe model kits, starting with making Roll blue.

As evidenced by the fact that that was months ago and I'm finally posting about it now, it took quite a while to get very far on this project!
I only got as far as priming the parts and painting a couple before I started the moving process and that killed all progress.

But it was the first thing on the list as soon as I got set up in my new place, which importantly finally had space for an airbrush setup.

It's been great so far! But very importantly I picked up an IKEA Vindstyrka air quality monitor so I can check when the fan has fully cycled all the air.
Without it I'd think things were fine and get a few lungfulls of paint nonsense and get a scratchy throat later.

I love the setup, but a few parts are pretty janky. I'm using my dad's old airbrush and compressor,
which means that the suction cups meant to hold it in place while it's working are totally useless and it'll wander all over the table if left alone.
So my solution is to throw it in a box with a weight and let it hang out in there.

Luckily the exact airbrush model is still supported despite being from the 90s.
It hadn't been used in well over a decade and a few parts were missing and I needed to replace them.

## Color matching

After that the next step was doing a bunch of paint mixing to try to match the source colors:

<img class="thirdimage" src="/assets/images/gunpla/roll/cyan_compare_2.jpg" alt="Cyan color painted over MegaMan.exe kit">
</div>

I'm pretty happy with all the colors I got. I especially like this masked line.

</div>

Unfortunately a few pieces had paint issues and one got lost in the move. So I'm now blocked on 3D printing a replacement.
Luckily it's pretty geometric so it's especially easy to replicate.

</div>

I'd like to put off setting up my printer, so for now I'm seeing how well the local library's printing service can do it.
Fingers crossed it comes out well!

## Latest progress

Here's the current state of things, with 95% painted, given a top coat, and assembled:
