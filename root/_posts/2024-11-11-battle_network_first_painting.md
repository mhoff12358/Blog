title: Color Matching Megaman.exe

## I was a HUGE battle network fan when I was younger

And I never really *stopped* being one, even though I don't really replay them much 'cause boy howdy can they be a bit tedious.
I don't have time to walk back and forth and back and forth doing random encounters to pad things out.

So I was super jazzed when I learned about the Kotobukiya model kits, and I waited super impatiently when they took FOREVER to actually release roll.exe after first announcing it.

My current project is to paint both of them with the colors swapped, and this is my attempt to mix paints to match Megaman's teal stripe color:

<div class="image-container">
<img class="fullimage" src="/assets/images/battle_network/megaman_color_match.jpg" alt="Megaman model kit with some color swatches">
</div>

<!--more-->

And here's some progress on actually getting roll.exe painted:

<div class="image-container">
<img class="fullimage" src="/assets/images/battle_network/roll_painting_blue.jpg" alt="Model kit parts painted a dark blue">
</div>

Unfortunately this project is on hold until I'm able to set up a new painting station, so it'll be a hot minute until it actually comes together.
