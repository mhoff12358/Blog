## Quite a while back I assembled and painted Chuchu's Demitrainer

I decided not to hit it with a topcoat 'cause I liked the matte look and only had glossy on me.

But then I saw the Chuchu model kit at a store and audibly gasped, and immediately took her home.

## Now her mech's not alone!

## Also I managed to do waterslide decals pretty dang well for it being my first time
