I went to a Mass of the Fermenting Dregs concert and it was awesome!

I was going to go see them late last year for their first US tour but I was feeling too blah to travel.
Then 2 weeks later I learned I had a serious illness, and suddenly retroactively felt super justified in having wussed out of taking a flight.

It would have been neat to catch them in a smaller venue, but it was also great seeing a whole crowd be excited!
Getting to go do this really cemented that I had gotten past my illness and so this was a big milestone for me.
