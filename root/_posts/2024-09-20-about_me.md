I'm MHoff (they/them). I'm a software engineer professionally but it turns out I really like making a bunch of shit in my spare time.

I bounce between hobby projects making shit based off my hyperfixations, and working on gamedev prototypes that go nowhere. It turns out making gamedev tools is more fun than making games so I never finish anything.

Making things-wise I do sewing, 3d printing, and model painting. I wanna do more woodworking but the tools are a pain to set up.

Programming-wise I enjoy cramming rust into things. I got a game written in wasm back before game engines had a bunch of support for it, and now I do stuff mostly Godot with Rust.
