I've had my desktop case set up with an Asuka/Eva Unit 02 theme for a while,
so after I saw someone had decorated the inside of their computer case with an anime figure sitting on the GPU I decided to go for the same thing.

Unfortunately all the figures of Asuka sitting down are... a lot... so I went with assembling a Unit 02 model kit. The recent Unit 02 RG kits were in stock so I grabbed one of those as well as a waterslide decal set.

It was my first time doing waterslide decals for something other than a character's face, so it was a bit of an adventure but I got the hang of it after the first few.

Posed in the case this is how it came out!

And here's the other side of the case, with the vinyl Unit 02 design I assembled on the back.

Also that IS a hole I hacksawed into the case so I could put an internal bluray drive on top of the case.
